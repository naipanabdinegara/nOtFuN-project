## Documentation  

### Understanding the Website Structure  

The `conf.yaml` file is the core of this project. It holds all the necessary information to render content on each page of your site. This file is designed to be easily understandable, even for beginners in programming.  

#### Key Elements in `conf.yaml`:  
- **`webname`**: The main title of your website, displayed in the top of the page.
- **`subname1`, `subname2`, ...**: Titles for each session or page of your site.  
- **`content`, `project`, `introduction`, `attribution`**: Columns that store actual content for each section, supporting text, arrays, and objects for more complex data structures.  

### Further Customization  
- **Formatting Text**: Use HTML tags and CSS to style text and other elements.  
- **Adding Images**: Use the `<img>` tag to insert images into your pages, ensuring the image path is correct.  
- **Creating Links**: Use the `<a>` tag to create links to other pages or external websites.  
- **Forms**: Add contact or registration forms using the `<form>` tag.  

### Additional Tips  
1. **Validate Syntax**  
   Ensure the `conf.yaml` file has correct syntax. You can use an online YAML validator to check.  
2. **Backup**  
   Always create a backup of `conf.yaml` before making major changes.  
3. **Learn Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
   Understanding these basics allows you to build more dynamic and interactive websites.
