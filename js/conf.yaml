It contains all the information needed to display content on each page. This file is structured in a way that's easy to understand and edit, even for those who are new to coding. </p> <br> <p> • webname: This is the main title of your website, which appears in the browser tab or at the top of the page. </p> <br> <p> • subname1, subname2, ...: These are the titles for each section (page) of your website. For instance, subname1 is the title for the first page (usually the homepage). </p> <br> <p> • content, project, introduction, attribution: These are columns that hold the actual content for each section. You can input text, arrays (for lists), or objects (for more complex data structures) into these columns. </p> <br> <h3> Further customization </h3> <br> <p> • Formatting Text: Use HTML tags, and others to format your text. You can also use CSS to style text and other elements. </p> <br> <p> • Adding Images: Use the <img> tag to add images to your page. Make sure the path to your image is correct. </p> <br> <p> • Creating Links: Use the <a> tag to create links to other pages or external websites. </p> <br> <p> Adding Forms: You can add contact forms or registration forms using the <form> tag. </p> <br> <h3> Additional Tips </h3> <p>  Ensure your conf.yaml file has correct syntax. You can use an online JSON validator to check. </p> <br> <p> Always create a backup of your conf.yaml file before making significant changes. </p> <br> <p> Understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows you to create more dynamic and interactive websites. </p> <br> <h3> Conclusion </h3> <br> <p> By understanding the structure of the conf.yaml file and utilizing HTML features, you can easily create a website that meets your needs. Don't hesitate to experiment and try new things! </p>
